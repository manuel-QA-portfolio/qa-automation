## 🚀 About Me

My career began in 2020, right in the middle of the pandemic, and I feel very fortunate to have found my passion and made it my profession.

Since then, I haven’t stopped growing. Having lived in the UK for almost five years made it much easier for me to adapt to this role quickly and effectively.

Shortly after joining, I was entrusted with all the documentation for a new international project. I created Gherkin scenarios, reviewed technical documentation (with support when needed), and executed all tests during installation. I was on-site with EUIPO users during UAT, guiding them through the application and resolving their questions. I really enjoy working with people, and this experience helped me grow both professionally and personally.

Later on, I was in charge of several strategic projects at EUIPO, leading teams of 6 to 9 people. During that time, I continued developing my skills as a QA Analyst, always learning and improving.

I’m currently working at Europcar, where I’m involved in key testing efforts related to the vehicle rental process. My focus includes end-to-end testing of the fleet lifecycle. I apply automation practices using Cucumber, Karate, and WireMock, simulate realistic environments with Docker and Test Containers, and validate event-driven flows using Kafka. Every day, I keep learning and sharpening my skills to contribute to the delivery of high-quality, reliable software.

What best defines me is my full commitment to everything I do. I am hardworking, responsible, detail-oriented, and constantly looking for ways to improve. My working style is direct and creative, and I put all the energy and enthusiasm I have into this field that I love.

I always keep an eye on the future—automated testing is gaining momentum, and that's why I am actively training and upskilling in this area.

This repository is designed to demonstrate my practical experience and coding style to recruiters and QA professionals.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

This portfolio demonstrates practical usage of:
- **Java 21**
- **Cucumber** (for Gherkin-style acceptance tests)
- **Karate DSL** (for declarative API testing)
- **WireMock** (for service mocking and stubbing)
- **Testcontainers** (for isolated test environments)
- **Gradle** (build automation with a focus on Kotlin DSL)

Each subfolder includes:
- A technical README
- A realistic structure similar to production test suites
- Empty placeholders where real test scenarios can be pasted

## 🧪 Scope of the Tests

- REST API validation
- Mocked service interactions
- Dynamic data-driven test cases
- Happy-path scenarios
- Realistic usage of WireMock and Testcontainers

> ❗ Note: These projects are **not meant to be executed**. They are structured to showcase test design, not to run in isolation.

## 📌 Notes

- All examples are adapted from real projects and fully anonymized.
- Test scenarios are written in English and will be added progressively.
- This portfolio is intended to demonstrate technical understanding, structure, and design of automated tests in professional environments.

## 🚀 How to Explore

- Go to [`/cucumber`](./cucumber) for Gherkin-based tests using Cucumber, Java, and mocking tools.
- Go to [`/karate`](./karate) for standalone, declarative API tests using Karate DSL.
